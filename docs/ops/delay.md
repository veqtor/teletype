## Delay
The `DEL` delay op allow commands to be sheduled for execution after a 
defined interval by placing them into a buffer which can hold up to 8 commands.
Commands can be delayed by up to 16 seconds

In LIVE mode, the second icon (an upside-down U) will be lit up when there is 
a command in the `DEL` buffer.
