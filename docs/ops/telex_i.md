## TELEXi Teletype Input Expander

The TELEXi (or TXi) is an input expander that adds 4 IN jacks and 4 PARAM knobs to the Teletype. There are jumpers on the back so you can hook more than one TXi to your Teletype simultaneously.

Inputs added to the system by the TELEX modules are addressed sequentially: 1-4 are on your first module of any type, 5-8 are on the second, 9-12 on the third, and so on. A few of the commands reference the module by its unit number – but those are rare.
